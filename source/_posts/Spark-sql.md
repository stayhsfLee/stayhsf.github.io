## Spark Sql Grammar

## Keywords

WITH

Referrence: [https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/sql-ref-syntax-qry-select-cte.html](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/sql-ref-syntax-qry-select-cte.html)

It's called `Common Table Expression`

Syntax:

```
WITH common_table_expression [ , ... ]

While common_table_expression is defined as
expression_name [ ( column_name [ , ... ] ) ] [ AS ] ( query )
```

LATERAL VIEW
---

Referrence: [https://spark.apache.org/docs/3.1.1/sql-ref-syntax-qry-select-lateral-view.html#content](https://spark.apache.org/docs/3.1.1/sql-ref-syntax-qry-select-lateral-view.html#content)

Syntax:

```
LATERAL VIEW [ OUTER ] generator_function ( expression [ , ... ] ) [ table_alias ] AS column_alias [ , ... ]
```

This clause follows after `original table` or `view` to append each row which is generated by `generator_function` to `each original output row`. Then you original table will contains more columns to become a wide table for speeding up the searchs.
